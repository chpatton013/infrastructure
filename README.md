# Infrastructure

This repository contains Ansible roles for several network-based software
services. Together these services comprise a scalable, fully-featured software
organization infrastructure.

### Disclaimer

All of this is experimental. I have no idea what I'm doing, I'm just trying to
learn how all these services work. The collection of services is liable to
change as I learn more about this.

### Requirements

* Install `pip2` with your package manager.
* Install pip packages: `pip2 install --requirement requirements.txt`

## NTP
## DNS
## DHCP
## NAT
## Firewall
## VPN
## User Auth (FreeIPA)
## CA (Dogtag PKI)
## SSO (Ipsilon IDP)
